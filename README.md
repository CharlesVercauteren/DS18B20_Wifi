# DS18B20_Wifi
This is an application for the wifi configuration software I wrote earlier. I have also
written an accompayning app voor macOS. Time, log interval and name can be configured. We
use commands that we send/receive using UDP.
Connection via terminal on Mac, use "sudo cu -s 9600 -l /dev/tty.usbmodem14102". Ise "~." to 
leave cu (~ is Option-n).
